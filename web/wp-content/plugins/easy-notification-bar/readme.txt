== Description ==
Adds a new section in the WordPress customizer so you can easily enable a notification bar on your site. The plugin allows you to enter your custom notification bar text as well as an optional button to display next to your text. Perfect for notifying visitors of a current sale or hot product.

The [Easy Notification Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-notification-bar/) plugin makes use of the newer "wp_body_open" action hook introduced in WordPress 5.2.0 which allows the plugin to work better with any theme that has been updated to support the tag. Contrary to other notice bar solutions which rely on absolute positioning, this plugin inserts the notice bar right after the body tag so it should display perfectly without any conflicts on any well-coded theme.

This is a "static" notification bar at the top of your site. When you scroll down the page it will become hidden which is generally better for usability and [SEO](https://www.wpexplorer.com/wordpress-seo/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't the notification display on my site even though I enabled it? =
This plugin makes use of the WordPress core "wp_body_open" action hook which should be added to every theme header.php file and was introduced in Wordpress 5.2.0. You will need to properly add this action hook to your header.php file and or contact the theme developer so that your theme is updated accordingly.

Feel free to ask in the support forum if you need help updating your header.php file. If you are using a free theme on WordPress.org please link to the theme in question. If you are using a premium theme, contact the developers for support since you paid for it.

= Can I display the Notification on my homepage only? =
Yes! There is a setting available so you can enable display for the homepage/front-page only.

= Can I create multiple notifications? =
By default this plugin adds a single notification bar to your entire site. However, you can use the "easy_notification_bar_settings" filter to alter the default settings conditionally. This will allow you to modify the message, button_text, button_link and every other setting via a child theme if you wanted to alter the notification bar for different sections of your site.

= How can I conditionally enable/disable the notification? =
The notification bar will display on your entire site if you have not selected the option to display on the homepage only, however you can use the "easy_notification_bar_is_enabled" filter to conditionally show/hide the notification bar.

= If there a premium version? =
No. This plugin is intended to be free and has everything you need to setup a simple notification bar for your site or homepage. This means there aren't any upsells or advertisments in the plugin.
