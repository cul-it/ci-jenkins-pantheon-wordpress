###⚡️ FEATURES

FileBird allows you to create virtual folders to categorize your WordPress media file uploads. So when you move files and folders, that won’t break permalinks to your images in the content.

With FileBird Pro you can save time on WP media management, search for any file & folder, sort them out, add product image gallery, download/export media folders, etc. That’s a great way to boost your admin workflow and productivity.

**Download Media Folder**
Export an entire folder including its subfolders and files in a single ZIP file. Keep the same folder structure.

###👍 HOW DOES FILEBIRD WORK?
Are you a WordPress website administrator?

Managing a WordPress site means that you’ll be adding tons of multi-media files such as images, videos, audios, documents, etc., into your WP media library.

As a result, your library has to store thousands of files and could become a total mess. WordPress default file name search function is a good thing but it will never match the ease of going directly to a folder. That’s when FileBird comes in to help with managing files in WordPress!

This media file manager gives you the ability to easily organize all files by drag and drop between folders. With FileBird in hand, things will be a lot better than they were.

The best thing about a folder-based structure is it makes it very easy to find the files you need and saves you so much time.

You won’t see WordPress media library not loading, as FileBird smart-loads one folder at a time.

###🚀 Tips to manage WP media folders like a pro with FileBird

* Upload multiple folders and their files directly from computer to WordPress
* Resize the left sidebar to get an overview of all folders
* Upload files to a specific folder by choosing the destination folder from the **drop-down**
* Easily **search** for the name of file/folder
* From the page/post composer, **browse** files and folders in the FileBird UI
* Use FileBird block gallery to insert multiple media files in a page, post, and custom post type
* Keep your folders uncluttered by clearing out the old files using **Sort** features
* Press ESC to exit bulk select mode

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I learn from other WordPress blogs and review articles that FileBird is free for up to 10 folders, but... =
Yes, 10-folder Free Tier was included in FileBird from its initial release until FileBird Lite version 4.4. In early 2021, we were requested by WordPress Review Team to change those terms of use. As a result, now you can [create unlimited folders](https://ninjateam.org/filebird-lite-important-notice/) in FileBird free version.

= Do all of my previously uploaded files remain the same after I first install this plugin? =
Yes, you can find all uploads in the **All Files** folder.

= When I move an image to another folder, does this action affect how the image appears in page/post? =
No, it makes no changes to your images on the site front-end.
