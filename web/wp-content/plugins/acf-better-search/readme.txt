This plugin adds to default WordPress search engine the ability to search by content from selected fields of Advanced Custom Fields plugin.

== Description ==

This plugin adds to default WordPress search engine the ability to search by content from selected fields of Advanced Custom Fields plugin.

Everything works automatically, no need to add any additional code.

Additionally you can search for whole phrases instead of each single word of phrase. As a result, search will be more accurate than before.

**New search core:** We modified the code of search engine. Content search is now faster by about 75% (depending on the level of complexity of searched phrase)!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/acf-better-search` directory, or install plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate plugin through `Plugins` screen in WordPress Admin Panel.
3. Use `Settings -> ACF: Better Search` screen to configure the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =

Plugin changes all SQL queries by extending the standard search to selected fields of Advanced Custom Fields.

= Where working advanced search? =

It works for WP_Query class.

= Do I need to add some arguments to my function to activate advanced search? =

Everythings works automatically. For custom WP_Query loop and get_posts() function also if you add [Search Parameter](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Search_Parameter).

= Whether the plugin works in the admin panel? =

Yes. The plugin works same as for the search page.

= In what fields does the plugin search? =

Our plugin supports the following fields: Text, Text Area, Number, Email, Url, File, Wysiwyg Editor, Select, Checkbox and Radio Button. All these fields may be located in both the Repeater or Flexible Content field.

= How does searching for whole phrases? =

The default search in WordPress is to search for each of words listed. This feature allows you to search for occurrences of the whole phrase entered in the search field without word division.

= How does Lite mode work? =

In this mode, the plugin does not check the field types. Phrases are searched in all ACF fields. Thanks to this, the query to the database is smaller and faster by about 25%. However, we do not have control over which fields are taken into account when searching.

= What version of Advanced Custom Fields is supported? =

Advanced Custom Fields in version 5 (also free). ACF below version 5 has a different data structure in database and is not supported.
