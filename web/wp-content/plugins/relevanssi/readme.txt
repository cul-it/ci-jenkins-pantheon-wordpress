Relevanssi replaces the default search with a partial-match search that sorts results by relevance. It also indexes comments and shortcode content.

== Description ==

Relevanssi replaces the standard WordPress search with a better search engine, with lots of features and configurable options. You'll get better results, better presentation of results - your users will thank you.

This is the free version of Relevanssi. There's also Relevanssi Premium, which has added features. For more information about Premium, see [Relevanssi.com](https://www.relevanssi.com/).

Do note that using Relevanssi may require large amounts (hundreds of megabytes) of database space (for a reasonable estimate, multiply the size of your `wp_posts` database table by three). If your hosting setup has a limited amount of space for database tables, using Relevanssi may cause problems. In those cases use of Relevanssi cannot be recommended.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin from the WordPress plugin screen.
1. Activate the plugin.
1. Go to the plugin settings page and build the index following the instructions there.
1. That's it!

Relevanssi uses the standard search form and doesn't usually need any changes in the search results template.

If the search does not bring any results, your theme probably has a query_posts() call in the search results template. That throws Relevanssi off. For more information, see [The most important Relevanssi debugging trick](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/query_posts/).

= Uninstalling =
To uninstall the plugin remove the plugin using the normal WordPress plugin management tools (from the Plugins page, first Deactivate, then Delete). If you remove the plugin files manually, the database tables and options will remain.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Knowledge Base =
You can find solutions and answers at the [Relevanssi Knowledge Base](https://www.relevanssi.com/category/knowledge-base/).

= Contextual help =
Answers to many common problems can be found from the contextual menu. Just click "Help" in the top right corner of your WordPress admin dashboard on the Relevanssi settings page.

= Relevanssi doesn't work =
If you the results don't change after installing and activating Relevanssi, the most likely reason is that you have a call to `query_posts()` on your search results template. This confuses Relevanssi. Try removing the `query_posts()` call and see what happens.

= Searching for words with ampersands or hyphens doesn't work =
Please read [Words with punctuation can't be found](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/words-ampersands-cant-found/). This is a Relevanssi feature, but you can fix it from Relevanssi indexing settings.

= Where are the user search logs? =
See the top of the admin menu. There's 'User searches'.

= Displaying the relevance score =
Relevanssi stores the relevance score it uses to sort results in the $post variable. Just add something like

`echo $post->relevance_score`

to your search results template inside a PHP code block to display the relevance score.

= Did you mean? suggestions =
Relevanssi offers Google-style "Did you mean?" suggestions. See ["Did you mean" suggestions](https://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/did-you-mean-suggestions/) in the Knowledge Base for more details.

= What is tf * idf weighing? =

It's the basic weighing scheme used in information retrieval. Tf stands for *term frequency* while idf is *inverted document frequency*. Term frequency is simply the number of times the term appears in a document, while document frequency is the number of documents in the database where the term appears.

Thus, the weight of the word for a document increases the more often it appears in the document and the less often it appears in other documents.

= What are stop words? =

Each document database is full of useless words. All the little words that appear in just about every document are completely useless for information retrieval purposes. Basically, their inverted document frequency is really low, so they never have much power in matching. Also, removing those words helps to make the index smaller and searching faster.

== Thanks ==
* Cristian Damm for tag indexing, comment indexing, post/page exclusion and general helpfulness.
* Marcus Dalgren for UTF-8 fixing.
* Warren Tape for 2.5.5 fixes.
* Mohib Ebrahim for relentless bug hunting.
* John Calahan for extensive 4.0 beta testing.

== Changelog ==
= 4.7.2.1 =
* For some reason the plugin files didn't update in the previous update, ie. 4.7.2 is equal to 4.7.1. This is the real 4.7.2 update.
* Minor fix: Media Library searches failed if Relevanssi was enabled in the WP admin, but the `attachment` post type wasn't indexed. Relevanssi will no longer block the default Media Library search in these cases.
* Minor fix: Adds more backwards compatibility for the `relevanssi_indexing_restriction` change, there's now an alert on indexing tab if there's a problem.

= 4.7.2 =
* Minor fix: Media Library searches failed if Relevanssi was enabled in the WP admin, but the `attachment` post type wasn't indexed. Relevanssi will no longer block the default Media Library search in these cases.
* Minor fix: Adds more backwards compatibility for the `relevanssi_indexing_restriction` change, there's now an alert on indexing tab if there's a problem.

= 4.7.1 =
* New feature: New filter hook `relevanssi_post_content_after_shortcodes` filters the post content after shortcodes have been processed but before the HTML tags are stripped.
* Minor fix: Adds more backwards compatibility for the `relevanssi_indexing_restriction` change.

= 4.7.0 =
* New feature: New filter hook `relevanssi_admin_search_blocked_post_types` makes it easy to block Relevanssi from searching a specific post type in the admin dashboard. There's built-in support for Reusable Content Blocks `rc_blocks` post type, for example.
* New feature: The reason why a post is not indexed is now stored in the `_relevanssi_noindex_reason` custom field.
* Changed behaviour: The `relevanssi_indexing_restriction` filter hook has a changed format. Instead of a string value, the filter now expects an array with the MySQL query in the index 'mysql' and a reason in string format in 'reason'. There's some temporary backwards compatibility for this.
* Changed behaviour: Relevanssi now applies minimum word length when tokenizing search query terms.
* Changed behaviour: Content stopwords are removed from the search queries when doing excerpts and highlights. When Relevanssi uses the untokenized search terms for excerpt-building, stopwords are removed from those words. This should lead to better excerpts.
* Minor fix: Improves handling of emoji in indexing. If the database supports emoji, they are allowed, otherwise they are encoded.

= 4.6.0 =
* Changed behaviour: Phrases in OR search are now less restrictive. A search for 'foo "bar baz"' used to only return posts with the "bar baz" phrase, but now also posts with just the word 'foo' will be returned.
* Minor fix: User Access Manager showed drafts in search results for all users. This is now fixed.

= 4.5.0 =
* New feature: New filter hook `relevanssi_disable_stopwords` can be used to disable stopwords completely. Just add a filter function that returns `true`.
* Changed behaviour: Stopwords are no longer automatically restored if emptied. It's now possible to empty the stopword list. If you want to restore the stopwords from the file (or from the database, if you're upgrading from an earlier version of Relevanssi and find your stopwords missing), just click the button on the stopwords settings page that restores the stopwords.
* Changed behaviour: Changes to post weights in the `relevanssi_results` hook did not affect the relevance scores shown in excerpts. That's changed now, and the displayed scores are now taken from the `$doc_weight` array, which is returned in the return value array from `relevanssi_search()`.
* Changed behaviour: Excerpt length and type are now checked outside the loop that goes through the posts. This reduces the number of database calls required.
* Minor fix: Searching for regex special characters (for example parentheses, brackets) caused problems in excerpts.
* Minor fix: Improvements in handling highlighting for words with apostrophes.
* Minor fix: Disregard hanging commas at the end of post exclusion settings.
* Minor fix: Sometimes excerpts wouldn't have an ellipsis in the beginning even though they should.

= 4.4.1 =
* Major fix: Returns the missing stopwords.

= 4.4.0 =
* New feature: It's now possible to exclude image attachments from the index with a simple setting on the indexing settings page.
* New feature: Page builder short codes are now removed in Relevanssi indexing. This should reduce the amount of garbage data indexed for posts in Divi, Avada and other page builder themes.
* Changed behaviour: The `relevanssi_page_builder_shortcodes` filter hook is now applied both in indexing and excerpts, and has a second parameter that will inform you of the current context.
* Minor fix: Stopwords weren't case insensitive like they should. They are now. Also, stopwords are no longer stored in the `wp_relevanssi_stopwords` database table, but are now stored in the `relevanssi_stopwords` option.
* Minor fix: A comma at the end of the custom field indexing setting made Relevanssi index all custom fields. This doesn't happen anymore and trailing commas are automatically removed, too.
* Minor fix: Accessibility improvements all around the admin interface. Screen reader support should be better, feel free to report any further ways to make this better.
* Minor fix: Doing searches without search terms and with the throttle disabled could cause problems. Relevanssi now makes sure throttle is always on when doing termless searches.
* Minor fix: Untokenized search terms are used for building excerpts, which makes highlighting in excerpts work better.
* Minor fix: Indexing did not adjust the number of posts indexed at one go like it should.
