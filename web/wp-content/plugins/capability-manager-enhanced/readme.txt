A simple way to manage WordPress roles and capabilities.

== Description ==

Control permissions requirements for your post types, and assign those capabilities to any WordPress role.

= Features: =

* Create or Copy Roles
* Manage Role Capabilities
* Enable type-specific capability requirements and assignments for any Post Type
* Enable distinct edit, delete and assign capabilities for any Taxonomy
* Some specialized support for WooCommerce Post Types
* Negation: any capability can be granted, not granted, or blocked
* Integration with other PublishPress plugins for advanced permissions and comprehensive publishing solutions
* Network: Copy any role to all sites, or auto-copy to future sites
* Backup (automatic / manual) and restore roles and capabilities to revert your changes

PublishPress Capabilities is professionally developed and supported by the experienced <a href="https://publishpress.com">PublishPress</a> team.

It has been a reliable tool since 2012, when PublishPress team member Kevin Behrens forked it from Jordi Canals' abandoned Capability Manager plugin.

To control assignment of PublishPress custom statuses, upgrade to <a href="https://publishpress.com/capability-manager/">Capabilities Pro</a>.

Pro membership also provides additional versatility and convenience through <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-permit-core">PublishPress Permissions Pro</a> integration. Capabilities added indirectly by supplemental type-specific roles (Page Contributor, Product Editor, etc.) will be highlighted in the Role Capabilities editor.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I grant capabilities for a custom post type? =

The custom post type must be defined to impose type-specific capability requirements.  This is normally done by setting the "capability type" property equal to the post type name.

= I have configured a role to edit a custom post type. Why do the users still see "You are not allowed the edit this post?" when they try to save/submit a new post? =

You may need to adjust your custom post type definition by enabling the map_meta_cap property. If you are calling register_post_type manually, just add this property to the options array.

= Even after I added capabilities, WordPress is not working the way I want. =

Keep in mind that this plugin's main purpose is to expose switches (defined capabilities). The wiring of those switches is up to the WordPress core or other plugins. If granting or removing a capability does not cause the expected results, your issue is probably with the other package.  With that context in mind, you are still welcome to <a href="https://publishpress.com/contact/">contact us</a> about it.

= Can role management be delegated? =

Yes. Users with the 'manage_capabilities' capability can edit roles. This Capability is created at install time and assigned to Administrators. You can add it to any role, but non-administrators cannot manage roles or users that have a higher role level than their own.

= Where can I find more information about this plugin, usage and support ? =
