WARNING: Semi breaking change in v1.0.2 - setting options have been added to switch Parallax & Particles on/off. With this update you'll need to turn these on via the settings page!

Granular Controls for Elementor brings additional controls to the ever popular Elementor Page Builder plugin.

This plugin gives you the options to set the Accordion's first tab to closed on page load, select a custom editor skin, set a specific section/column to appear after a certain time (Delayed content),   
schedule a section/column to be displayed during a given date period by setting the start and end date, plus much more to come.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

3. Visit Elementor > Granular Controls to access the settings - other settings are accessible via the Editor and set on per page/section/column basis.

== FAQ ==
**I've switched Particles on and they overlay my content, how can I fix this?**

To resolve this any widgets placed in the section will need a higher z-index - Go to the Advanced tab of each widget and set the z-index to 1 & save     

**I can no longer see the controls for Parallax and/or Particles, Why?**

In order to avoid scripts being loaded on sites that are not using these options a setting control has been added where they can be switched on and off as needed - See Elementor > Granular Controls > Editor Options.   

**I do not see the Exit Bar in the Editor, how do I get access to it?**

You can enable or disable the bar via the settings page - Visit Elementor > Granular Controls > Editor Options to activate it.    

**When I turn on the Admin Dashboard Page I loose my admin widgets too, what's wrong?**

As the admin page is being modified this may happen on some sites but the widgets are not lost - simply click on the screen options and turn them on again.
