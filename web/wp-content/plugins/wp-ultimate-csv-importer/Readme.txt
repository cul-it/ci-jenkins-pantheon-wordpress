== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Common Issues =
1. What are reasons for my import to break?<br />
Import may hang due to the following reasons<br />
	* CSV not properly validated.<br />
	* CSV not properly encoded to UTF-8.<br />
	* System Requirements are not matched the required values.<br />

2. How to validate a CSV? <br />
CSV Importer plugin allows you to import CSVs that are validated. So kindly validate your CSV using [CSV Lint](https://csvlint.io/). Your CSV may have any escape characters and misplaced skip characters which may cause the import to cease.<br />

3. What are the supported CSV Formats? <br />
Wordpress CSV Importer plugin recognizes only the UTF-8 encoded characters. You can check on the UTF-8 encode with CSV Lint. Any chance if you are using Excel, we recommend you to use Google Sheets. Excel will miss some characters to be encoded to proper UTF-8.<br />

4. What are the Minimum Requirements needed to upload CSV? <br />
Basic System Requirements need to be met to upload a CSV with bulk of records. Kindly check your System Requirements by Settings â†’ Security and Performance on CSV Importer plugin settings tab. You have to increase the system requirements values to the minimum values mentioned in the plugin. <br />

5. Why my featured images not getting uploaded? <br />
The importer uploads images in the background for faster performance and it requires WP-Cron to be enabled. You can [easily configure WP-Cron](https://www.smackcoders.com/blog/enable-configure-wp-cron.html?utm_source=wp_org&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=faq) for smooth and speedy import. <br />

6. What are the supported custom fields in FREE version? <br />
The importer supports [default WordPress Text and Text area fields](https://www.smackcoders.com/blog/adding-custom-fields-data-wordpress-free-wp-ultimate-csv-importer.html?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=faq). You can also import the Text & Text area fields created with custom codes in WordPress standards.
