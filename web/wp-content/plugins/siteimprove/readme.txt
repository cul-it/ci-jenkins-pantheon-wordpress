Siteimprove allows users to continuously test, fix and optimize their work through actionable content and analytics insights. Works with WooCommerce.

== Description ==

The Siteimprove plugin bridges the gap between WordPress and the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform. You are now able to put your Siteimprove results to use where they are most valuable – during your content creation and editing process. With analytics and content insights always at hand, contributors can test, fix, and optimize their work continuously . Once the detected issues have been assessed, you can directly re-recheck the relevant page and see if further actions are needed. Delivering a superior digital experience has never been more efficient and convenient.

Siteimprove Plugin can be installed like any other Wordpress module.

1. Place it in the plugins directory for your site and enable it on the `wp-admin/plugins.php` page.
