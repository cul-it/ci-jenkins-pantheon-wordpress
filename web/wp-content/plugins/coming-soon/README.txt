= What's the difference between Coming Soon Page Mode and Maintenance Mode? =

Coming Soon Page Mode returns a http status 200 and allows your site to be indexed by Google and other search engines while under construction. You should always be using Coming Soon Page mode when your site is under construction. 

Maintenance Mode returns a http status code 503 and should be used when you are doing short term maintenance on an existing site. This will let search engines know your site is under going maintenance and should return in 1 day when maintenance mode is finished.

= Who can see the website while it's under construction? =
Only logged in visitors can see the website while you website is under construction. Logged out visitors will see the coming soon page or maintenance mode page depending on which mode you have selected.

= Disabled Coming Soon Plugin and it still shows =

This is always a caching issue. Go to the caching plugin's setting page and clear the cache.

= Can I build my entire site with this page builder? =

This page builder is intended for landing pages only. If your website only had a small number of pages you could in theory only use SeedProd. However if you have a large website there are other page builders with the wordpress.org plugin repo that will let you build your entire site. 

= Does it work with WooCommerce? =

Yes, you cam build custom Product, Checkout and Cart pages with our WooCommerce integration. Note: WooCommerce Integration is only available in the Pro verison.
